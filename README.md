### DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection of Sales Transaction Data
The paper explores the efficacy of DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoders in detecting fraudulent sales transactions. The dataset contains variables related to product sales and is comprised of 133,731 train set observations and 15,732 test set observations. Data cleaning and feature creation are first applied to both data sets. Each of the models is then fit on the train set, and predictions of fraud/not fraud are obtained from the test set. Different iterations for each of the models above are tested by varying model parameters. Model performance is then evaluated by comparing the modelâ€™s test set predictions of fraud/not fraud versus the actual fraud outcomes using the F1 score.

**Software:** R

**Methods:** DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, Anomaly Detection.
